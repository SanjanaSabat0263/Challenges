Create a div that represents a card element.
Apply Tailwind CSS box shadow utilities to give the card a subtle shadow effect.
Inside the card, include:
A heading (<h2>) for the card title.
A paragraph (<p>) for some card content.
The card should have padding of 24px, a white background color, and rounded corners with lg class to enhance the design.
